Hi, I'm Andrew Wansley.

I live in San Francisco, and I'm taking some time off between projects. Feel free to contact me with opportunities you think I'd find interesting.

Previously, I was a product manager at Google. I've contributed to Google Now, Google Maps, and the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gM5qCkFJdfvaaG4e-6tDRUSw3rNxv8CUzXGkCplAM6E/preview).

Before that, I was a CS/Econ major at Dartmouth, and a debater on APDA. Props to you if you can find some old debate videos on YouTube.

I am [@awans](http://www.twitter.com/awans) on Twitter and [andrew.wansley@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.wansley@gmail.com).
