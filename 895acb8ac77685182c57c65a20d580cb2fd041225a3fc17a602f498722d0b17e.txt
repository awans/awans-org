Mai,

I’m not into feet.
I don’t identify as someone who is generally into feet, at least in a sexual way.
I mean like I think basically everything is interesting and there’s certainly a lot to be interested in about feet.
Like how we depend on them for ordinary mobility—for exercise, for going to the store, for standing up (to bad treaties, for example), for kicking (ass, for example).

Or how they’ve evolved over time, or how they function socially, like what’s the deal with high heels? Or sandals?

Anyway, point is:
I’m kinda into your feet?
Not like I wanna suck on them when we have sex or anything, more just that I like having them around.
And your toes are cute.

Go kick ass in Ottawa with your cute feet.

Love,
Andrew
