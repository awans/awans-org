Giftr is a small gift list app that I wrote for my family to help out with Christmas.

The idea -- all credit to my mother -- is for every person to have a list where other folks can comment
or coordinate on what gift to get them, but without the recipient seeing.

I've re-written it once a year or so for fun. This year I decided to release it on Sandstorm.

Hope someone out there finds it useful!
