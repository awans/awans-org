I'm a technologist and software engineer. I'm interested in databases, security, and climate change.

## Professional

I started my career as a product manager at Google where I contributed to Now, Maps, and OAuth 2.0. After that, I was CTO of [Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/), a healthcare CRM. I've spent the last year building [Aft](https://aft.dev), an indie backend-as-a-service.

I'm currently working as generalist freelance software engineer. I have special expertise in building secure, performant, highly flexible systems like CRMs, or databases.

I'm also available to help early startups establish a security program, especially those working in healthcare.

## Personal

I live in San Francisco. I try to enjoy the beautiful nature all around the Bay Area, whether hiking, on my bike, or just keeping my eyes open. I make [music](https://soundcloud.com/awans), and sometimes share it online.

I facilitate a Bay Area [men's group](/mens-group/). I'm an advocate for a strong sense of ethics at technology companies, as well as making them accessible and welcoming to as many people as possible.

This domain is named after _monstera deliciosa_, a beautiful house plant.
