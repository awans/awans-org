Hi, I'm Andrew Wansley.

I live in San Francisco. I'm the CTO of [Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/).

Previously, I was a product manager at Google. I've contributed to Google Now, Google Maps, and the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gM5qCkFJdfvaaG4e-6tDRUSw3rNxv8CUzXGkCplAM6E/preview).

Before that, I was a CS/Econ major at Dartmouth, and a debater on APDA.

You can find my code at [github.com/awans](https://www.github.com/awans) and my music at [soundcloud.com/awans](https://www.soundcloud.com/awans)
I am [@awans](https://www.twitter.com/awans) on Twitter and [andrew.wansley@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.wansley@gmail.com).
