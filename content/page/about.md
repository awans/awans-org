I'm a technologist and software engineer. I'm interested in databases, security, and climate change. 


I started my career as a product manager at Google where I contributed to Now, Maps, and OAuth 2.0. After that, I was CTO of [Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/), a healthcare CRM. I've spent the last year building [Aft](https://aft.dev), an indie backend-as-a-service.

## Work

I'm currently working as generalist freelance software engineer. I have special expertise in building secure, performant, highly flexible systems like CRMs, or databases.

I'm also available to help early startups establish a security program, especially those working in healthcare.
